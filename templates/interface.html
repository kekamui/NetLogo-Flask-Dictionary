      In NetLogo, you have the choice of viewing models found in the Models Library, adding to existing models, or creating your
      own models. The NetLogo interface was designed to meet all these needs.</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.2em">The interface can be divided into two main parts: NetLogo menus, and the main NetLogo window. The main window is divided
      into tabs.</p>

  <p class="move-text-left">On a Mac, if you are running the NetLogo application, the menu bar is located at the top of the screen. On other platforms,
    the menu bar is found at the top of the NetLogo window.

                          <h3 class="move-text-left">Tabs</h3>
                          <p class="move-text-left">At the top of NetLogo's main window are three tabs labeled "Interface", "Info" and "Code" . Only
                            one tab at a time can be visible, but you can switch between them by clicking on the tabs at
                            the top of the window. Right below the row of tabs is a toolbar containing a row of controls.
                            The controls available vary from tab to tab.</p>

                          <h3 class="move-text-left">International Usage</h3>
                          <h4 class="move-text-left">Character Sets</h4>
                          <p class="move-text-left">NetLogo always saves and loads models in the UTF-8 character encoding, which includes a wide range
                            of international characters.</p>

                          <p class="move-text-left">If you are in a locale other than U.S. English, let us know if you have any trouble using your
                            local character set.</p>

                          <p class="move-text-left"> The Transition Guide has advice on converting models containing international characters from earlier
                            NetLogo versions.</p>

                          <h4 class="move-text-left">Languages</h4>
                          <p class="move-text-left">Most of NetLogo's GUI, and some of its error messages, are now "internationalized". This means
                            that it is now possible to display NetLogo in different languages.</p>

                          <p class="move-text-left">We say "possible" here because the current release of NetLogo only supports English, Spanish, Chinese,
                            Russian, and Japanese.</p>

                          <p class="move-text-left"> The work on internationalization is not complete. We are asking for help from the user community
                            in helping us localize items such as the menus and error messages.</p>

                          <h4 class="move-text-left">Default Language</h4>
                          <p class="move-text-left">By default, NetLogo uses the same language your operating system is set to, if available. (If unavailable,
                            you get English.)</p>

                          <p class="move-text-left"> You can record a preference for a different language by changing the "User Interface Language"
                            option in the preferences dialog. Once a new language is chosen you will have to restart NetLogo.</p>

                          <h4 class="move-text-left">Support for translators</h4>
                          <p class="move-text-left"> We hope NetLogo will become available in many different languages. If you would like to translate
                            NetLogo to your language, see this wiki page for instructions.</p>
