      <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>NetLogo</strong> is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural and social phenomena. It was
        authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999 and has been in continuous development ever since at the Center for Connected Learning
        and Computer-Based Modeling.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>NetLogo</strong> is particularly well suited for modeling complex systems developing over time. Modelers can
        give instructions to hundreds or thousands of "agents" all operating independently. This makes it possible to explore
        the connection between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level patterns that emerge from their
        interaction.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>NetLogo</strong> lets students open simulations and "play" with them, exploring their behavior under various
        conditions. It is also an authoring environment which enables students, teachers and curriculum developers to create
        their own models. NetLogo is simple enough for students and teachers, yet advanced enough to serve as a powerful
        tool for researchers in many fields.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>NetLogo</strong> has extensive documentation and tutorials. It also comes with the Models Library, a large
        collection of pre-written simulations that can be used and modified. These simulations address content areas in the
        natural and social sciences including biology and medicine, physics and chemistry, mathematics and computer science,
        and economics and social psychology. Several model-based inquiry curricula using NetLogo are available and more are
        under development.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.2em"><strong>NetLogo</strong> is the next generation of the series of multi-agent modeling languages including StarLogo
        and StarLogoT. NetLogo runs on the Java virtual machine, so it works on all major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux,
        et al). It is run as a desktop application. Command line operation is also supported.</p>
